Inspired by the https://github.com/K-Francis-H/little-stars-hack/blob/main/camera_feed_pygame.py file and some other file. I used it as a base to create my own Python Script.
What it does: See the Live-Stream of the A9 mini WiFi-Camera in your Browser. It sets up a Server and presents a MJPG Stream to the URL: http://127.0.0.1:8081/cam.mjpg or you can also use http://127.0.0.1:8081/cam.html
Use the AP Mode of the Camera and connect your device with it. Then run the script like this: python3 a9.py
Have fun
