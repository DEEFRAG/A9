Inspired by the https://github.com/K-Francis-H/little-stars-hack/blob/main/camera_feed_pygame.py file and some other file.
I used it as a base to create my own Python Script.

What it does:
See the Live-Stream of the A9 mini WiFi Camera in your Browser.
It sets up a Server and presents a MJPG Stream to the URL: http://127.0.0.1:8081/cam.mjpg or you can also use http://127.0.0.1:8081/cam.html

How to use it:
Use the AP Mode of the A9 mini WiFi Camera and connect your device with it.
Then run the script in a terminal window like this: python3 a9.py

My Version of the A9 mini Wi-Fi Camera uses the Little Stars App and the SSID starts with BCCQ.
There are also other Versions out there. It clould be that your variant of the A9 mini WiFi Camera is not compatible with this script.
